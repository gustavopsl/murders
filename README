########### In terminal ###########

cd ~ # move to home directory

mkdir projects # make a new directory called projects

cd projects # move to ~/projects directory

mkdir murders # make new directory called murders inside of projects

cd murders # move to ~/projects/murders/

mkdir data rda # make two new directories, one is data the other is rda folder

ls # to check if we indeed have one data folder and one rda folder

pwd # check the current working directory

mkdir figs # make a directory called figs to store figures

########## In RStudio ########

# pick existing directory as new projects

getwd() # to confirm current working directory

save() # save into .rda file, .RData is also fine but less prefered

ggsave("figs/barplot.png") # save a plot generated by ggplot2 to a dir called "figs"
